# zigzag-traverse-array

ALGO EXPERT HARD 

Write a function that takes in an n x m 2D array(that can be square-shaped when n == m)
and returns a 1D array of all the array's elements in zig zag order.

Zigzag order starts at the top left corner of the 2D array, goes down by one element,
and proceeds in a zig zag pattern all the way to the bottom right corner.

Sample input:
             array = <br>
                      [ <br>
                      [1,  3,  4, 10], <br>
                      [2,  5,  9, 11], <br>
                      [6,  8, 12, 15], <br> 
                      [7, 13, 14, 16], <br>
                     ] <br>

Sample output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]
